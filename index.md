<h1>Hi there!</h1>
~~~

I'm Anooj, a research engineer currently working at Freenome leading the Deep Learning Engineering  
efforts. Currently I'm focused on scaling large neural networks and novel genomic epigentic foundation 
models to one of the world's largest cfDNA cancer and disease dataset.

<h1>Current Projects</h1>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/anoojpatel/metaxu/tree/main">Metaxu Language</a></h2>
Currently building a modern functional-style programming langauge for systems programming. It features
algebraic effects, a modal system for borrow checking (like Jane Street's Oxidized Ocaml) and algebraic
subtyping via SimpleSub. Currently the first iteration is written in Python and compiles directly to C.

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<h2>Dark Chess Engine</h2>
~~~

Built the first [dark chess engine](https://github.com/anoojpatel/ImpCatcher) utilizing some of the 
great imperfect-information Nash equilibrium solving algorithms, like Counterfactual
Regret Minimization and Multi-Objective Information Set Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

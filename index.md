<h1>Experience</h1>

<h2><a href="https://beacon.bio">Beacon Biosignals</a></h2>
~~~

Developed deep learning models to solve the biggest problems in
neuroscience with the smartest experts on the largest brain datasets!

~~~
<h2>IBM Watson</h2>
~~~

Work as an Intern for 2 summers for the Open Source Data and AI Team. 
Contributed to Spark (Keras to [SystemML](https://github.com/apache/systemds) model conversion engine),
working on Model Asset eXchange, and doing some research on 
GANs for time series data ([audio and financial](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Audio-Sample-Generator)).

<h1>Current Projects</h1>

<h2>Dark Chess Engine</h2>
~~~

Currently trying to build the first [dark chess engine](https://github.com/anoojpatel/ImpCatcher) utilizing some of the 
great imperfect-information Nash equilibrium solving algorithms, like Counterfactual
Regret Minimization and Multi-Objective Information Set Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

~~~
<h2> Quantitative Finance</h2>
<h3> Limit OrderBook.jl</h3>
~~~
Developing a Julia implementation of a high throughput, efficient Limit Orderbook.
This simulating, recreating orderbooks, NBBO generation, backtesting,
live trading, etc.

~~~
<h3> Signature Method applied to Financial Time Series </h3>
~~~
Currently working on implementing a simple library for Signature Method
for machine learning applications.

~~~
<h3> AlgoTradingPipeline.jl </h3>
~~~
*Planned*
My goal is to create a simple framework like Flyte, but for the core components
of an algotrading system in Julia. Mainly a project to learn but also to add
value for beginners and folks with short runways on prototyping a pipeline.
